# Sorting-Algorithm-Report
This repository contains the project I developed for CMPT 295, which analyzes the performance of three sorting algorithms: merge sort, quicksort, and Timsort. The project compares various aspects, including compiler and assembly optimizations, branch predictability, cache performance, and overall efficiency.
